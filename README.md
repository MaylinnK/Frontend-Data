# :grapes:BerryDex

## Take proper care of your pokémon! Dont feed them berries they dont like.:x:
Not many people know about this, but the pokémon that fight for you actually have a berry preference. Feeding the right berry to your pokémon can have additional effects for the pokémon, which will help you during combat.  
Using the Berrydex, you can check what every berry tastes like so you know you're not putting you pokémon through hell trying to eat it.:sparkles:  
This program uses the PokéAPI to receive berry data. It then loops through different links in order to gather details from the different berries. The purpose of this program is to create an interactive visualization of the berries in Pokémon where users can see the properties of each berry and know what effects they have.
